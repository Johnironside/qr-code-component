## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3


### What I learned

I just started learning web design, and so far i've gotten a taste of how it works in real life. One thing i really find useful is the this: 

```html - linking an external font from google fonts.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit">
```
```css - use of flex as a display value
.container {display: flex;}
```

### Continued development
I plan to expand my knowledge on the use of div in html and structuring divs with css.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me to get solution to some of the problems i encountered. I was able to go through similar problems from people and the solutions provided. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing resourses which provided me with documentations on various elements. I'd recommend it to all web developer.
